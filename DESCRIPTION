Description: The method is invented by A. T. Fomenko. Its idea is as follows.
       Two mathematical functions defined on the same segment are given, and one aims to
       identify statistically, whether the locations of local maxima of the first function
       are correlated to those of the second function.
       Given that both functions are defined on the same finite segment, the locations
       of their local maxima are nothing else than the vectors that belong to a certain
       compact domain in a higher-dimensional space. (Technically speaking, the
       dimensionality of the second vector may be different from that of the first vector,
       however, one can correct this by inserting zero-valued elements into the shorter
       vector.) By adoptig the null-hypthesis that those vectors are distributed uniformily
       over that compact domain, one can estimate the probability that the distance
       between them is smaller than the measured value. This estimate represents the
       desired p-value.
